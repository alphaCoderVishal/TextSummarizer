Imagine that you are the Director of Customer Relationships at AllElectronics, and you have five
managers working for you. You would like to organize all the companyâ€™s customers into
five groups so that each group can be assigned to a different manager. Strategically, you
would like that the customers in each group are as similar as possible. Moreover, two
given customers having very different business patterns should not be placed in the same
group. Your intention behind this business strategy is to develop customer relationship
campaigns that specifically target each group, based on common features shared by the
customers per group. What kind of data mining techniques can help you to accomplish
this task?
Unlike in classification, the class label (or group ID) of each customer is unknown.
You need to discover these groupings. Given a large number of customers and many
attributes describing customer profiles, it can be very costly or even infeasible to have a
human study the data and manually come up with a way to partition the customers into
strategic groups. You need a clustering tool to help.
